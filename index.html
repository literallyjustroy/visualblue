            I am a Northern Kentucky University student, and all-around good-guy, pursuing degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics.

            I am a Software Engineer looking to improve and practice software design and development.
            <br><br>
            I currently work at <em>GE Corporate</em> as an intern for the Identity Management Team. At GE I have grown as a
            developer, and have also provided great value to my team. I have gotten to experience the agile process, testing,
            full-stack development, and gained a ton of invaluable knowledge.
        </p>

        <div>
            <h1><i class="fa fa-code fa-2x"></i> Technically,</h1>
            <hr>
        </div>
        <p>
            I enjoy solving problems and engineering <em>beautiful</em> software solutions. As an intern, I have had the
            "pleasure" of working with some <strong>poorly</strong> engineered code, and understand the distinct soul-crushing
            sadness involved in maintaining it. Though there is great pleasure in refactoring this sadness, it's not always
            practical, and so, in clean coding, I strive to preserve the sanity of future engineers.
            <br><br>
            I have experience in many different technologies and design patterns, but more importantly, I have a lot of
            experience in general problem solving. If you do want to know which specific technologies I've worked with, they are
            available on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roykanesmith/">my LinkedIn.</a>

            Some day, there will be a beautiful field of links here -- for now, the dirt lay bare.
